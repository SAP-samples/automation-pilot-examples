## Description

In this example, we'll explore the capabilities of SAP Automation Pilot to create subaccounts and make basic configurations.

The example command utilizes the **SAP Cloud Management Service (cis-sapcp)** provided catalog to:

* Create new BTP subaccount.
* Configure entitlement for *SAP Cloud Management Service (cis)*.
* Create service instance and key of *SAP Service Manager*, which can be used to manage service instances.
* Create service instance and key of *SAP Cloud Management Service (plan local)*, which can be used to setup environments and subscriptions.

Customers can easily modify the example command to fit their scenarios. For example, adding additional entitlements or creating additional service instances.

:information_source: Make sure to check the other examples in the [BTP Provisioning](../README.md#btp-provisioning) section.

## Requirements

To use this example you'll need the following:

* BTP global account
* Platform user with access to the BTP global account
* Instance of [SAP Cloud Management Service](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/8ffcd3a4-2d85-4a04-a762-be3e31f78a7c) with plan *central* and a service key/binding with default configurations. They must be created in a separate BTP subaccount in the same global account. When creating the service instance you must choose Password as the Authorization Type:

## How to use

Import the content of [examples catalog](catalog.json) in your Automation Pilot tenant. Navigate to the *PrepareSubAccount* command and trigger it.

You'll need to provide values for the following input keys:

* *displayName* - Display name of the BTP subaccount
* *region* - Technical name of the BTP region, where the subaccount will be created
* *subdomain* - Subdomain of the BTP subaccount
* *admins* - Additional users with subaccount administrator role collection
* *user* - UserID/Email for BTP user account used for authentication
* *password* - Password for BTP user account used for authentication
* *serviceKey* - The original JSON, presented by *SAP Cloud Management Service (plan central)*

You'll receive the following output values after successfuly executing the command:

* *cisServiceKey* - Service Key for *SAP Cloud Management Service (plan local)*
* *smServiceKey* - Service key for *SAP Service Manager (plan subaccount-admin)*

:information_source: These output values are marked as sensitive and their value cannot be displayed in the UI. However, they can be referenced and used when composed in another command.

## Expected result

Let's execute the *PrepareSubAccount* command with the following input:

* *displayName* - Example Subaccount
* *region* - cf-eu10
* *subdomain* - example-subaccount-12d68ccf3a09
* *admins* - ["john.doe@sap.com"] *Note: Use your Email address*
* *user* - *BTP technical user*
* *password* - *BTP technical user password*
* *serviceKey* - *Service key for SAP Cloud Management Service (plan central)*

Execution is started and we can monitor its progress:

After a few seconds, the execution should finish successfully:

![Finished Execution](assets/finished-execution.png)

We can verify that the command was successful by checking BTP Cockpit:

![BTP Cockpit - Created Subaccount](assets/btp-cockpit.png)

Subaccount has the correct region, display name and subdomain:

Subaccount has two services instances with bindings:
